Everytime when we try to get info from browser(i.e client) a request and response takes place between the server and client which is called REQUEST RESPONSE model or CILENT SERVER architecture.


                                        request
          CLIENT        -------------------------------------------------------->    SERVER
        eg-browser
                        <---------------------------------------------------------
                                        response



Example -
We are trying to access https://www.google.com/maps

        (Domain Name Server)          real address of server
                DNS                 https://221.58.211.16:443 
                                 protocol | IP address   | port number
    dns lookup  |   |             https   |              | default https:443
                |   |           or http   |              |  http: 80

               CLIENT


    https://www.google.com/maps
protocol  | domain name   | resource
https or  |
http

When we try to access https://www.google.com that is not the real address of the google server, The request is made to DNS through our ISP(Internet Service Provider) 
DNS is just like a phonebook it matches the domain name with IP address. 
the request sent by client to DNS is called DNS lookup,
DNS responds with the real address of the server.

- Client makes the request to DNS lookup and gets back the real address,


        DNS                         HTTP REQUEST
        (DNS lookup)    ----------------------------------------------------->
                                    TCP/IP socket connection  
        CLIENT      --------------------------------------------------------      SERVER
    https://221.58.211.16:443 <-----------------------------------------------
protocol  |IP address    | port number          HTTP RESPONSE


After reciving the real address of the server there will be a connection established between client and server known as TCP/IP socket connection
Connection between server and client and server is kept till we transfer all the files of website

Communication Protocol
    System of rules to allow 2 or more party to communicate

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
IP - Internet Protocol 
They both are communication protocols

HTTP request (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is also another communication protocol, through which client and server communicates by sending request and response messages 

ex -    GET     /maps HTTP      /1.1            ---> Start line
    HTTP method  request target  HTTP version

    Host:www.google.com
    User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0                      ---> HTTP request headers

    <BODY>                                      ---> In case we are sending data

Few of the http requests are 
1.GET           to get the data
2.POST          to send the pata
3.PUT              to edit  
4.PATCH             the data

HTTP response

HTTP/1.1        200             OK          ----> start line
http version    status code  status text 

Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2019
Content-type : text/html                -----> http response header
Transfer-encoding: chunked

<BODY>                                   ----> html or json data


When the client recieves the 1st response after the 1st request it will only be html file,
Later all the other CSS, JS files will be requested,
For each file new http request for the server,
There will be multiple request and response at same time

TCP/IP socket connection
Transmission Control Protocol
    Decides how data travel along the website

    TCP breaks all data of request or response into small packets of chunks once it reaches the server or client it assembles to form the original data, this done to speed up the process

    IP Send and route all these packets through internet using ip address on each packet
