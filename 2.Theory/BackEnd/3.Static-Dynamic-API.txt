Static
Simple website contains html,css and js server just reads all these files and responds to the client there is no server side processing 

            HTML, CSS  ------------- Browser ------------Screen
             and JS

ex- jonas.io the content of the page remians all the time you open up that page
Page can be made dynamic using javascript but that doesn't mean the website is rendered dynamically


Dynamic
contains a database then app is running which reads the database and fills the template with the data creating a webpage everytime a request is made this is known as server side rendering
-Built on server each time new request comes in

Database ---- Get Data ------ Build     ------ HTML,CSS and ------ Browser ----- Screen
                              Website               JS
            Template ---------|

website change all the time based on the data in database
ex- twiter every time we login we see diff posts as there is new data in the database

Web Application 
Website with functionality like login, signup, send mail  etc


API  (Application Programing Intereface)
In a simple terms when a request is made instead of rendering the webpages we can send all the data required as a JSON file and this file can be further used to render website on the browser side using front end stack

Using the data website is dynamically created on the browser

                                                            other front-end tech

        
It's better to build API because we can use these API for any front end tech
ex - if we want to build a native app we can use the data rendered from the API and use it to create whatever native apps we want.
