Node Process
As we know node is build using c++ and JS when we say node process is running its basically node's code running in the cpu, 
    In Node all the codes are excuted in a single thread, for any number of users /** It's really important that we do not block the code **/ 
In other languages like php a new thread is created for new users.

Thread
    Set of instructions

                            1.Intialize - Node is intialized
                            2.Execute top level code - The codes which dosen't include callbacks
                            3.Require modules
                            4.Register event callbacks
                            5.Start event loop        -------------->              Thread Pool

Almost all the processing happens in event loop but for handeling heavy task the event loop off loads the task to the thread pool, Thread pool consits of 4 additional threads which can be configured upto 128 threads but 4 threads are enough

Offloads the work to thread pool
