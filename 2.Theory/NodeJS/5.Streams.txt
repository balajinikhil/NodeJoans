Stream 
Instead of reading the whole file and writing it we can read that file in chuncks and respond with the data

Used to process(read and write) data piece by piece (chunks) without completing the whole read or write operation and therefore without keeping all the  data in memory;
ex - netflix, youtube

1.Perfect for handling large volume of data;
2.More efficent data processing in terms of memory (no need to keep all data in memory) and time (we don't have to wait untill all the data is available) ;

Node Streams

1.readable streams - Streams from which we can read the data    ex- http request, fs readStream        events- data, end functions- pipe(), read();

2.writeable streams - Streams from which we can write the data;     ex- http response, fs writeStream    events- drain, finish        functions - write(), end();

3.duplex streams - Streams that are both readable and writeable         ex- net websocket connection

4.transform stream - duplex streams which transforms data as it is written or read      ex- zlib gzip creation
