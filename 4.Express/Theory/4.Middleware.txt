Whenver a request response cycle appears an request object and response object is created these objects pass through the middleware and whenever they reach request or response, 



REQUEST  ------- middleware -------- middleware ----- middleware ------ middleware ------ RESPONSE 
                    next();             next();         next();             res.send();       
                    parsing body       logging          setting             router
                                                        header              

Everything is a middleware (even routers);

Creating middleware 
app.use(middleware(req,res,next){
    //functionality
});

We have access to request and response in each middleware;
next() - It is important to include next at the end of the code

If we don't mention any route that middleware will then apply to each and every route;

**Order matters if a middleware is applied after certain route then it won't apply to that route;

3rd party middleware 
We can use 3rd party middlewares by installing them as packages and requring those modules;

morgan - show the response start line;

app.use(morgan('dev'));
