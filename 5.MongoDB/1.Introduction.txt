MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores a file in form of collections and document

Defenition -
MongoDB is a document database with scalability and flexibility that we want with the querying and indexing that we need.

MongoDB
database    ----------  Collections ----------  Documents

                        blogs --------------------single article
                        contacts ---------------  single contact

Key Features
1.Document Based - mongoDB stores data in document (field value pairs)
2.Scalable - Very easy to distribute data across multiple machines as users and amount of data grows 
3.Flexible - no document schema is required, so each document can have different numbers and types of fields
4.Performant - Embeded documents, indexing, sharing, flexible documents,native duplication etc



Documents are sotred in form of BSON , which is similar to JSON but are typed like string,array etc,
ex - {

|fields|  |values|
    "id":Object(1021335252),
    "name":"aurthor";
    "learning":["mongodb","nodejs"],
    "comments":[
        {"name":"aurther"},
        {"name":"john"}                <---------- embedded documents
    ]
}

Embedding / Denormalizing 
    Including releated data into a single document, this allows far quicker acces and eassier data models (it's not always the best solution)
