Aggregation 
This is a mongoDB feature to transform collection into agregatted result
We can manipulate data and get required stats and results

This is called on model, they are array of objects
 
Tour.aggregate([
    { 
        $match: {field:{$operator:value}} -- matches the fieldName and filters the doc with matching result
    },
    {
        $group:{                                                     --groups the document based on the mentioned id 
            _id: "$difficulty",
            avgPrice:{
                        $avg:'$price'                                 --calculates the average of the specified field
                     }
        }
    }
])

few other aggregate pipelines are

3.$unwind :'$fieldName' -- sperates array of values into single values by creating new object for each value in array

4.$addFields:{
                newField:value   month:'$_id'                              ----- adds a new field to each group
             } 

5.$project :{
                _id:0                                       --removes id field form the group
            }

6.$limit: 12 -- total number results allowed
