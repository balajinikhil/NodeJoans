Virtual Properties
    These are the properties which are not essential to be stored in database and can be derived from other properties
    ex - distance in km and miles we can store any one and derive another form one of them


These are passed on to schema, it will be called every time someone tries to -- get 

nameSchema.virtual('fieldname').get(function(){
    return //code 
    this -- points to the document 
})

At the end of Schema after passing the schema model we have to specify inorder to display virtual properties

nameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  
    //schema_model
    
    },
    {
     
     toJSON:{
                virtuals:true
            },
     toObject:{
                virtuals:true
              }       


    })


    We cannot do query on virtual properties as they are not stored in the database
