1. We do a post method by entering email and password

//email and password destructured
let {email, password} = req.body;

check if email and password field is filled or not
        if(!email || !password ) -> error with message - enter email and password


2. Check if user exists with that email

 checkUser = User.findOne({
     email:email
 }).select('+password')     //  as password select will be false we have to add + sign

 and check for password matches by using modules

 //In model
 schema.methods.checkPassword = function(newpass, pass){
     return bcrypt.compare(newpass, pass)
 }

//In auth controller
const check =  checkUser.checkPassword(password,checkUser.password)

 if(!checkUser || !check ) -> error  email or password incorrect

 
 3. create jwt and send response

 token = jwt.sign({id:checkUser._id}, SECRET, {
     expiresIn: EXPIRE
 })

 res.json({
     checkUser,
     token
 })
