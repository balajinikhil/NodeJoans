For such routes we should have another middelware

ex- deleting particular content
    editing particular content
    

app.use('/authorizedRouteOnly', authentication.middelware,  authorized.middelware,  routeHandler)

//In authentication middelware we have discussed in previous file

//In authorized middelware

    //In model we should have a role schema with enum and default as user

We have to pass input in authorized.middelware('admin','lead-guide')

In order to acess this
we pass it into function and return another function form that function




                        //will break down the input into array --> REST operator
authorized.middelware = (...roles){

    return (req,res,next)=>{
                            //will be availabel form authentication.middelware
        if(!roles.includes(req.user.role)   return next(error) --> you are not authorized to acess this routes
    next();
    }
