For data modelling different things to consider before modelling

1.Different types of relationships between data
2.Referencing/Normalizing VS Embedding/Denormalizing
3.Referencing or Embedding ??
4.Types of Referencing


1.Types of relationships between data
It can be basically divided into 3 Categories they are
    a.   1:1 - one to one relationships
            ex - 1movie ---- 1name

    b. 1:MANY
        This is again divided into 3 types 
            
            i.1:FEW

            ex- 1 Movie --- few awards

            ii. 1:MANY

            ex - 1 Movie -- MANY reviews

            iii. 1:TON

            ex- 1 App --- TON error log
    
    c. MANY:MANY
        ex : 1 Movie ---- MANY actors
             1 actor ---- MANY Movies

2.Referencing VS Embedding

Referencing consits of a parent document which has many children documents and these parent documents holds the children document's ID so the child is refernce of a parent

Embedding consits of a main document and children documents are embeded into the body of the parent documents so the parent holds the data children also

Referencing 
    Advantage:
    Performance it's easier to query each documents on it's own
    Disadv:
    need 2 query to get data from refernce documents

Embedding
    Advantage:
    Performance we can get akk the information in one query
    Disadv:
    Impossible to query the embeded docs on it

Referencing ex :

    document --- movie{

                actor 1:{
                        //ID
                        },
                
                actor 2: {
                        //ID
                        }


                    }

 children documents  --- actor1:{
                            //ID
                                }

                    ---actor2:{
                        //ID
                            }

Embedding ex: 
document -- movie{

            actor1:{
    
                    },
            actor2:{

                    }

                }
